<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The application is  centered around city planning with the objective of reducing traffic congestion and journey time. The cityâ€™s road network is modelled by a graph as shown below (Figure 1) with nodes representing locations and edges representing roads connecting a pair of locations. Edges are bidirectional in the sense that journeys can take place in either direction along the edge. 

The objective of the city planner is to determine which new roads need to be built in order to meet the twin objectives of reducing journey time and traffic congestion.

## Agent Architecture

This project will utilize a model-based, utility-based agent (Table 1).  As a partially observable, sequential, dynamic, continuous  multi-agent task dynamic programming (DP) is the preferred algorithmic method. 

<b>Table 1 - Aritificial Intelligence (A.I.) Project Archetype</b>

| Type        | Sub Type            | Algorithm                |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Model-based | Utility-based Agent | Dynamic Programming (DP) |

As a result, applying a model-based, utility-based agent is the preferred architecture (Fig 2).

### Traffic Simulator
The pseudo code for the Traffic Simulator module is outlined below:
```shell
    for seconds in (8 AM - 6 PM) # 10 hour time span
      for second in seconds:
        trips = generate_trips(trip_count=100)
   
      for road in city_map.get_random_roads():
        calculate_volume(road, trips)
```

### Traffic Analyzer
The pseudo code for the Traffic Analyzer module is outlined below:
```shell
    new_roads = 3
    benefit_matrix(x, y)
    build_benefit_matrix(benefit_matrix)
     
    for road in new_roads:
      # Should randomly select two nodes that are not directly connected
      build_new_road(city_map, road) 
      update_benefit_matrix(benefit_matrix)
  
    identify_roads_with_highest_benefit(road, benefit_matrix)
````

There are various mathematical proofs that must be theoretically applied.  Given the fact that there are n number of budgeted roads (eg. 3) a maximum benefit is never reached for this particular project.  However, for completeness and mathematical compliance the following proofs still apply.

The expected reward of the given actin (a) of the agent, which in this case is the city planner is as follows:

<b>Expected reward given the action (a) is selected:</b>

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?q_{\text{*}}(a)%20=%20\mathbb{E}%20[R_t%20|%20A_t%20=%20a]" />

<br>

where <br>
E = Expectation of taking an action <br>
t = time the action is taken <br>
R = Reward given after the action is taken <br>
A = Action actually taken <br>
a = In general, the action taken to evaluate the recommended road benefit:

<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{Benefit}(x,y)%20=%20\text({spd}(x,y)%20-%20d(x,y))%20*%20(n_t(x,y)%20+n_t(y,x))%20=%20B1\\%20+%20\sum_{n%20\in%20N(y)}%20\max%20\left(%20\text{spd}(x,n1)%20-%20d(x,y)%20-%20d(y,n1),%200%20\right)*(%20n_t(x,n1)+%20n_t(n1,x))%20=%20B2%20\\%20+%20\sum_{n%20\in%20N(x)}%20\max%20\left(%20\text{spd}(y,n2)%20-%20d(x,y)-%20d(x,n2),%200%20\right)*%20(n_t(y,n2)%20+%20n_t(n2,y))%20=%20B3" />
<br>

Estimation of the average rewards actually received:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q_{t}(a)%20=%20\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}%20R_{i}%20\cdot%20\mathbb{1}_{A_{i}=a}}{\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}%20\mathbb{1}_{A_{i}=a}}" />

where the indicator function 1 predicate denotes the random variable that is 1 if the predicate is true and 0 if it is not.

Note, At is the greedy action to select the roads that have the greatest beneft to the city:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A_t%20=%20\underset{a}{\mathrm{argmax}}%20\%20Q_t(a)" />
<br>

where argmax(a) denotes the action (a) for which the expression that follows is maximized (with ties broken arbitrarily).  In this particular problem, we will simply choose the roads that have the greatest benefit in descending order.  Greed action selection always exploits current knowledge to maximiize immediate reward.  In other words, the city planner will spend no time sampling inferior road benefits to see if other roads might really benefit the city even more.

If the denominator of the reward estimation function is 0 then we instead define Qt(a) as some default value, such as 0.  As the denominator goes to infinity, Qt(a) coverges to q*(a).  This proof is defined by the limit below.

Assume the benefit B(x,y) is defined on rewards for all tuples (x,y) in some open interval containing the rewards actually received Qt(a), except possibly at Qt(a). The limit of B(x,y) as (x,y) approaches Qt(a) is L:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lim_{(x,y)%20\to%20Q_t(a)}%20B(x,y)%20=%20L" />
<br>
<br>
where for every Îµ > 0 there is a Î´ > 0 such that if for any number of road recommendations 0 < |(x,y) - Qt(a)| < Î´, then |B(x,y) - L| < Îµ.
